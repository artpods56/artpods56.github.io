\lettercontent{Dear Sir/Madam,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
